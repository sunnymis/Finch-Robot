The code that we have compiled so far is primarily designated to work with a Finch in a simulator 
within software, with a secondary goal of working with a Finch in hardware.  Through the course of
Stage 1, we have discovered that the task of ensuring that the Finch follows through simple commands
was more difficult than it had appeared.

In Stage 1, we have only completed four objectives so far, considering that our TA Jen had told us that 
completing 3/9 of the objectives was sufficient for submission.
