Notes to the instructor:

We have worked diligently on this project, testing various implementations and methods of getting the
robot to perform various tasks. As a result, we have extra code within our main class, FinchController.
that is not currently being used. This includes code that has been commented out, as well as methods that
have the public access modifier of "private." One particular method, traverseEntireMaze(), was
intended to cause the robot to traverse the entire maze, reading temperature (and light) values.
However, the full implementation of the method was never completed. Additionally, some of our JUnit tests
may be a little lackluster i.e., the tests themselves don't tell the user much, other than
if the program ran correctly. The real feedback to the user is the tangible Finch robot
and the display of the graphical user interface. While we only completed three parts 
of the project,specifically parts 1, 2, and 5, we feel that the code contained within our project is 
representative of the learning processes associated with this project. Certainly, more improvements 
may be made in the (near) future.
