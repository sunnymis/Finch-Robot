To test the various custom defined functions of the Finch, do the following:

Place the Finch on the Perch in the bird cage.
To begin, open the Testing.java class. From here you can call each of the methods
to make the Finch Robot do its various tasks. 

The main method of the testing class first instantiates a new FinchController object, which 
takes in a reference to a new new Finch object:
		FinchController fc = new FinchController(new Finch());

Additionally, the main method calls the addTerminateButton method of the FinchController class, which displays
a button to screen for easy termination of any currently running code executions
		fc.addTerminateButton();
		


Lastly, again from within the main method of the Testing class, you can call the following methods
which perform the listed funtions:

traversePerimeter()
	This method, which must be called on a FinchController class, causes the Finch to traverse around
	the entire perimeter of the maze and return to the perch. It does not display any map or GUIs.


findBrightLight()
	This method, which must be called on a FinchController class, causes the Finch to find the brightest spot
	in the birdcage (with minimum light value of 234) and stop underneath it.

drawPerimeter()
	This method, which must be called on a FinchController class, causes the Finch to traverse around
	the entire perimeter of the maze and return to the perch. Additionally, it displays a GUI which 
	displays a map of the birdcage, live, as the birdcage is being traversed.
