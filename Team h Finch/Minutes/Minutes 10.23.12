What We Accomplished
-	We took a substantial amount of time breaking down the problem and figuring out what we need to accomplish first
-	We made a list of explicit, small tasks to accomplish that build upon one another
-	We figured out our meeting times and pair-coding schedule

Plans for Upcoming Week
-	I’m going to email my group members the meeting times and what tasks need to be accomplished 
-	We are going to figure out the first couple of items on the list
-	We are going to make sure that we document all along the way
-	I’m going to ask Dr. Alphonce about item #8 and about the JUnit testing
